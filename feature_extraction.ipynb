Tempogram: A time-frequency representation that captures the local tempo (rate of beats) of a signal.\n","2. Onset strength: The strength of onsets (the beginning of a note or percussive event) in the audio signal. This is useful for detecting the location of beats.\n","\n","Once we have the features, we can process them to detect beats. There are various algorithms for beat detection, such as dynamic programming-based methods, spectral methods, or autocorrelation methods. One simple approach is to use the librosa.beat module to estimate the tempo and detect beats based on the onset strength:\n","\n","This script uses the onset strength to estimate the tempo (in BPM) and detect the beat times (in seconds). \n","\n","Keep in mind that this is a basic example of beat detection.
